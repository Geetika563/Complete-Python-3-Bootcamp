set: Unordered collecetion of unique elements.   set={1,2}
  .add(1)  [to add an ele into a set]
  What is the result of set([1,1,2,3]) == {1,2,3}

If we don't want to assign anything just give->  b=None  [this wont return anything]
=> type(my_list)    [this gives the data type of my_list which is  a list]

To write in a file:-
    %%writefile myfile.txt
    Helloo
    HII
    How are yuhh

=> to open this => myfile=open(myfile.txt)
=>to read this =>  myfile.read()              [gives the text in a file as a string with \n for a new line]
=> if we again read this, nothing will be printed so doo=> myfile.seek(0)
    [this will make the cursor to be at starting index to read again]
=>  myfile.readlines()    [to give each line as sepearate object(more convenient to read)  with \n]
